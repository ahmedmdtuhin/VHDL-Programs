# VHDL-Programs Repository

This repository is a collection of VHDL projects and lab exercises created to practice and demonstrate digital logic design using various modeling techniques. It includes fundamental logic gates, conditionals, adders, counters, and a full FSM-based voting machine project with a certificate of completion.

## 🔍 Featured Project: FSM-Based Voting Machine

The `Voting_machine_project_with_FSM` folder includes a complete project that:
- Uses Finite State Machine (FSM) design methodology
- Is implemented in Vivado using VHDL
- Includes simulation files, synthesized design, and source files
- Demonstrates secure voting, result display, and reset functionality

> A certificate of successful completion is included.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- VHDL constructs: `when else`, `with select`, `if else`, `case`
- Structural vs. dataflow modeling
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Clock division and counters
- Assertion and reporting for testbenches

## 🛠 Tools Recommended

- Vivado Design Suite (for simulation/synthesis)
- ModelSim or GHDL (for simulation)
- Any VHDL-compatible text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode with VHDL plugin)

## 📜 Certificate

Included in the root directory for validation and academic proof of the FSM project implementation.

## 📄 License

This repository is provided for academic, educational, and demonstration purposes. No commercial license is applied.
